00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:11,030
So now we have as an
intermediate station this state diagram for our

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,350
clock and have seen now in particular

00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,840
these transitions between such complex
hierarchically or otherwise composite states.

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,270
We will first deal with what

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,600
this means in each case
and also which perhaps different possibilities

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,680
of such transitions there
are between composite states.

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,150
And for this we look first at
what the entry possibilities are into a

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:41,600
hierarchical state of this kind, thus still without
region and first of all only the entry.

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,720
Every transition consists potentially of
an exit and an entrance.

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,920
Let's have a look at
the very flexible possibilities to

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,340
realize the entry in composite states.

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,240
We look at a hierarchical
state, quite times more deeply nested.

00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,160
There is this outer nesting level A.

00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,480
Inside there is a sub-state
C and another sub-state B,

00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,520
which itself is also composed of D
and E and then other elements appear.

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,350
So we will have four
different possibilities to enter here.

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,500
The standard entry, that would be the one that
just appeared on the slide for the A transitions.

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,150
Then there's explicit entry, where you
don't enter the hierarchical state from the

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,250
outside as a whole as
this outer arrow suggests here, but

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,970
you explicitly select a sub-state, and
then there are entries via so-called shallow

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:51,980
and deep history, for which somehow
these H or H* nodes are used.

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,560
As a note:

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,450
I don't have triggers at
these entry arrows in each

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,410
case, in general of course and it
will be the same for the following slides.

00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:08,240
In general it would be
possible to specify a trigger here,

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,790
like A in the example here.

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,890
There it is an entry and
the arrow says a as a trigger.

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,430
You could also imagine
this with these arrows here,

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,050
I just didn't draw it here.

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,520
We will come to the
history nodes in a moment.

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
It is important to note
and also to take into account,

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,560
if you create state diagrams yourself,

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,640
that there may be only one outgoing
arrow from each of these H- or H*-nodes.

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
This is otherwise not the
case for the individual sub-states.

00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,500
And here are also no triggers
on this arrow only on the entry

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,880
arrows or if necessary also
on the arrows here could be

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,390
triggers, I have omitted
them in this stylized example.

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,060
So let's have a
look at the possibilities now.

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,250
We do it one after the other:

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,200
We start with the standard entry.

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,150
The default entry simply ensures that in
each hierarchy level that we have in

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,290
the composite state, simply the
respective start state is addressed, or

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,020
since there are no parallel regions, simply
the start state of the top hierarchy level.

00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,510
So in our example, if
we enter this hierarchical state here

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,990
via this standard entry,
then that means what?

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,390
Then the outermost level start state would
be chosen, which would be this one.

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,850
What does this one do?

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,960
It has a transition, a standard
entry, into this composite sub-state B,

00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,060
because this is also a standard entry via
the start state, the start state present here

00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,430
would be selected
for this hierarchical level.

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,690
That again points to D, i.e.,
the standard entry here would ensure that

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,300
ultimately the sub-state D becomes active,
because the start state of the

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,750
outer hierarchy level is selected,
that has a standard entry into

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,740
this sub-state and there again is
the start state points to D.

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,250
So continuation at this entry at
B and in B again at D.

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,650
Then there is the explicit entry.

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,450
This simply ensures that the continuation takes place
at exactly the explicitly specified substate, i.e. in

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,780
our example it simply leads to
a continuation at C, because this

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,785
explicit entry points exactly to C. It could also have pointed to
D or E. In this case, the explicit entry points to C.

00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,270
It could also have pointed to D or E.

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,070
Then these would have
been the relevant next states.

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,630
This possibility of the explicit entry also
means that we don't always need a

00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,050
start state on every level, if we
always proceed by explicit entry, we wouldn't

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,650
have to have start states
everywhere, but we may of course.

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,220
There was still this
entrance reality about the

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,830
history and these are also
the more complex complicated ones.

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,260
We first consider the deep history.

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,680
In which sense is
this historical, so to speak?

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,270
There it is about the fact that we
can visit a sub-state and thus also a

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,420
composite state several times
by jumping back and forth.

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,680
So let's assume, in our example,
that we have already been in one

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,900
of these states C,D,E in
one of these innermost sub-states.

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,110
Then we have been somewhere else,
perhaps in another component of the

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,430
overall state diagram that may have
been drawn in here, and then at

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,590
some point we return to hierarchical
state A via this deep history.

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,550
What happens then?

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,350
What is supposed to happen then is
in the deep history that exactly the

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,870
sub-state of the innermost
level, of a respective

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:39,140
innermost level, is accessed from where we
left the overall state A the last time.

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,080
This is what it says here.

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,300
If the composite state, in our case now
the A, was already visited once before, then

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:55,550
the last sub-state of the lowest
possible hierarchy level active there is entered.

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:07,430
If we last left from D, then
we would now also continue again at D.

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,750
If we last left from C,
then we would continue at C.

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,650
Lowest here means C is already a
non-hierarchical state, so C would also be

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,010
its deepest level because there
are no further nested sublevels, while

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,110
B, for example, is not a deepest level state
because there are still D and E in there.

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,330
The whole thing can also be that we
have to do this per region, so to speak.

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,060
Not yet in the example just
now, where we have no regions, but

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,880
if we have a hierarchical state with
subregions, then it may also be that we

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,160
have to go to the last
active substate in each case per region.

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,650
If we have never been to the hierarchical

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,260
state, in this case A, what happens then?

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,590
If we have never been here before
somehow and we come across this entry,

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,020
this deep history node, then we wouldn't
know, should we continue at C,D or E,

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,050
because we have never been here
anywhere and we haven't remembered anything, then

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,920
it is simply followed the
arrow that starts from this H*.

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,230
That is the role of this arrow here.

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,310
It doesn't mean that we always go to
E, but only if we come into this

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,180
A via this entry here and we've never
been to A before, then this arrow tells us:

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,100
Then we continue at E.

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,110
If, on the other hand, we have already
been in C, D or E before we

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,690
return here, then we also
continue at the respective place.

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,820
This describes the deep history
and similarly, but subtly different,

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,200
the shallow history behaves, because there
we also return, if we have already

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,000
been in this composite
state, basically back to

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:20,690
where we were before we last left,
however not to the lowest level, but to

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,210
the respective of the highest
hierarchy level the last overall state.

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,830
So let's imagine in our
example again that the last

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,110
time we were here we were at E, if we

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,900
then came over the deepest history
we would continue at E not because

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,620
of this arrow but because E
was the last sub-state visited here.

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,760
If, on the other hand, we come
across the shallow history, then we look:

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,660
We were last in E, but E is
part of B, so in this outermost level, if

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,150
we look: what is the next lower level of

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,290
nesting, have we been last in
B because we have been in E.

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,250
I.e., if we come over the shallow history,
then we would say, we continue at B.

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,500
But to continue at B then means to
take the starting state of B, that is

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,900
D, what is here.

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,410
If the composite state A was last
left from E, then we now continue

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,780
at B, because B is the top
nesting level, so to speak, in which E

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,740
occurs, and to continue at B means to continue at
D, however, because D is the starting state of B.

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,650
If one has never been at
all in this composite state, then

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,440
one proceeds analogously as
with the deep history, thus

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,260
if we have never been at all in
the proximity within A and we come over the

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,620
shallow history exactly as with the deep history,
then one simply continues there where this arrow

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,560
starts from the H-element and in
the case that would mean to continue

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,790
here and that would also mean to
continue at D in the concrete case.

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,085
That is the role of this arrow.

00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:27,920
This arrow is not there for us to
always continue at D, so even if this

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,780
arrow here were to point to C, for
example, then we would indeed go to C if

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,830
we have never been inside A, but if
we have been inside A, for example in E,

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,990
then we would actually continue regardless of
where this arrow points, the next time

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,860
we enter via the flat
history node at D, because

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,800
we would look we have already been
here in E, the outermost overall state in

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,200
which E occurs, in which we have already been,
is B and the starting state of B is D.

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,710
There one must simply read through these rules very
exactly and follow very exactly and comprehend at the example,

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:16,760
then it becomes clear what the meaning
of the entries is in each case.

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,580
Beyond that there are still
further possibilities of the entrance, in

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,560
particular there is
the so-called entrance point.

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,930
This is shown in a different way.

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,610
We will not deal with it.

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,200
That's a possibility in
the UML state diagrams

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,540
that we won't look at in this lecture.

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,570
That was the discussion of
the possibilities that we see here.

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,470
That was a hierarchical
state without a region.

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,600
Now we still need to look at,
what happens if we have a region state?

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Then there are
potentially other possibilities.

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,190
I'll leave out the history inputs for now,
so as not to complicate the picture unnecessarily.

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:11,180
However, in the wristwatch example, there
will also be such an entry with

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,936
regions where we also
have history in play.

00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,980
So in a region state there
is still the possibility of standard entry,

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,270
still the possibility of explicit
entry, still also cases for shallow

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,070
and deep history, which I have not
drawn in here now, and in addition

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,680
there is the possibility of entry via
a fork and this is of course the

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,270
same kind of fork node
as occurs in activity diagrams.

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,720
That's used here to sort of

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,330
target multiple sub-states
in the individual regions.

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,550
Here it is obvious that we
are actually jumping to a state in

00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,190
each region, but this must also
be the case for the other two

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,390
possibilities, because for regions we are
always in a substate in both regions.

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,060
I.e., although this default entry looks

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,800
like it points to only one region, the
actually points to the entire region state, and

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,378
we must also select a substate in
each of the two regions on entry.

00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,790
The same is true for the explicit entry.

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:22,370
It explicitly points to a sub-state in
a region, yet when explicitly entering a

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,860
region state, we have to
select a state in each region.

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,770
So we still have to describe
what that means in each case.

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,520
Namely, what are the rules here?

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,860
The default entry is very simple.

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,810
Just like we just took the
starting state of the outermost level

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,550
of the hierarchy in the default entry
into a hierarchical state, now we just

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:03,470
take the starting state per region, so if
we come to this region state via this entry

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,350
here, then we're just going
to choose the starting state in

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:16,565
each region, so in that case we would be in A
in the first region and in C in the second region.

00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:17,023
How about the explicit entry?

00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:21,860
There is also clear, there we obviously want to
be in sub-state B in the first region, but at

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,130
the same time we have to
do something in the second region.

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,120
What do we do there?

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,360
Obviously we take the start
state of the other region.

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,610
So one state of one
region is jumped to directly.

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,690
This is done by the explicit entry
and in the regions parallel to it we

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,760
take the start state in each case, so

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,330
in our example over this arrow we enter in the
first region in B implicitly in the second region in C.

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:04,010
Then there is the case of the fork and
this is also very obvious, because via the fork we

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:12,530
address a special state in each region,
so if we enter via this fork, then

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,120
of course we will choose B as the
substate in the first region, and D as

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:26,510
the substate in the second region, because that
is exactly what this representation here gives us.

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,800
These are all cases except for the fact
that we would also still have the possibility

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,960
to link regions and history.
