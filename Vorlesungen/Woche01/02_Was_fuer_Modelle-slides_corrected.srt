00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,820
All right, let's start with a little introduction
to modeling, or to this course in terms of

00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,820
content.

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,880
Obviously, it is about models.

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,461
And first of all, we should approach the
question of what kind of models we are

00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,550
going to talk about.

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,550
What are models?

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,789
I'm sure you have some kind of
colloquial idea of a model, i.e., model

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,039
cars or a 3D model in architecture.

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,210
Yes, those are all models, colloquially.

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,019
And the question is, of course:

00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,650
Are we also concerned with such models?

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,970
And what is to be modeled here?

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,970
Why?

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,020
And a little bit already:

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,590
What are the different types and characteristics
of models that will be relevant to

00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,940
us here in the course?

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,520
Instead of just the
colloquial notion of a model.

00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,980
So first, of course, we
can try to define it.

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,260
What is modeling or what
is a model for us?

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,450
And defining that is not so easy
because it can mean just about anything.

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,100
As you can see from
the colloquial examples I just mentioned.

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,390
So for us, we could define it like this:

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,649
A model is a representation, not
the real thing, but only a representation

00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:14,649
of something.

00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:19,189
And that is, quite
generally speaking, a system of objects, relations and/or

00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:20,189
processes.

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,299
All these terms, "object", "relation", "processes",
could, of course, refer in computer

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,530
science to software
products, for example.

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:33,979
But, of course, one can also capture
other real-world relationships in the same way.

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,860
So, it's about representing
something, representing a system.

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,539
And then it says here:
a model simplifies and abstracts.

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:44,539
So, as a rule,
of course, you don't make a model.

00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,719
A model is not the real thing, so
the model car is not the real car, but

00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,530
a simplification/abstraction of it.

00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,770
So, somehow this system, which is
at issue, is simplified and abstracted.

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,270
For example, by
considering only relevant properties.

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,240
Of course, the question of what is
relevant depends on the purpose of the

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
model.

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,240
What do I want to do with it?

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,720
Do I have the model car just to be
able to look at it, at home in the living

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,820
room, when I can't be yearning
for my car in the garage?

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,580
Or do I want to
do something with the model?

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,780
For example, as an engineer, I might want
to investigate properties of the system by first

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,450
examining the model more closely.

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,860
Other properties may be relevant,
and therefore need to be simplified.

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,210
And systems can be all kinds of things.

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,070
If I want to say up here that
we represent a system, then I have to ask

00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,500
myself, or you could ask me:

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,820
How do you define "system"?

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,670
Again, it was very generally
used at first.

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,790
Of course, one can already think of a computer
science system, some software, or a hardware prototype,

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,990
for example.

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,390
But in general, we can say (and
many examples in the lecture will not

00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,790
only be from the computer science
context), in general, a system could either

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,320
reflect a part of reality or
be a section of reality, or a

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,450
not yet existing entity.

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,680
So, something that is there, that one
wants to describe, preferably by a model.

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,130
Or something that one wants to build/create and
therefore wants to look at a model in

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,000
advance, or create, look at, work with.

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,870
So that is an alternative, so to speak.

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,730
Does the system already exist or
is it yet to be created?

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,260
And another distinction
that is also relevant:

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,910
The system could be something tangible.

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,040
In the case of the model car, it
is tangible, both the model car itself and

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,540
the real car of which it is a model.

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,020
Both would be tangible things.

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,240
Or virtual.

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:56,670
So, if I look again at the 3D
model of a skyscraper to be built, then

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,990
the skyscraper, as a system, would,
of course, be a tangible system of

00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,400
objects, consisting of all its floors, the beams,
all the building materials, for example, and the

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
parts of the skyscraper formed from them.

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,540
The 3D model, which is created on the
computer beforehand, is of course, something only virtual.

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,500
But a system itself
could also be virtual.

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,040
When we talk about a software
system, it itself is not tangible.

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,450
So both models and systems
can be tangible or virtual.

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,280
And an information technology system
can also be tangible, of course.

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,150
So, an augmented reality system
that you might want to build.

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
That would be the system.

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,460
And before that, you make
a plan of it, a model.

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,150
That's a very general
first version of these terms.

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,020
All right, then, what is modeling?

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,030
That's actually the question up here.

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,530
So, modeling is very likely the
process that gives rise to a model.

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,650
And actually, we take the starting point:

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,590
We have a system or
we want to create a system.

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,410
In order to be able to better grasp,
understand, analyze it, we first want to have a

00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,410
model.

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,440
Modeling would then be the process
that creates a model for the system.

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,030
And for that, of
course, we need to simplify/abstract.

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,360
Since the model represents the system in
a simplified and abstracted way, certain steps of

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,200
simplification have to be taken.

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,710
And these can be quite different
model-building processes, which we will see

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,660
in different forms in the lecture.

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,830
For example, this includes delimiting what
parts of reality you actually want to

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,020
capture in the model.

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,270
So, you first have to cut the system out
of the overall reality in order to be able to

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,740
say what is to be modeled here.

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,100
So, you have to separate the
model, even the system, from the rest.

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,210
Reduction, simply omitting details.

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,070
So you may not need to represent
the entire system in its full glory.

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,300
The model is usually simplified, just
like the model car doesn't contain all

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,310
the details, maybe not even the
engine, that is in the real car.

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,780
Because if you're just using the model car
to look at it, it doesn't need to

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
have an engine.

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:11,310
So you can reduce things, you can decompose,
you can imagine the system broken down into its

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,750
parts, or capture how it's
actually made up of subsystems.

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,949
And that can lead to one being able
to form a better model about it, simply

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,270
by carrying out this decomposition of the system
into its parts mentally, and then modeling the

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,270
parts.

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,419
Then the overall model is simply
the sum of these partial models.

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,970
Or summarize things,
abstract from details.

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,199
Different processes, mental processes,
partly also technical processes, play a

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,199
role there.

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,600
And we will see them in
action with many examples in this lecture.

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,430
Why are we doing this?

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,080
Yes, that's what I've just
been hinting at again and again.

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,920
Maybe we want to design a
system first or understand an existing system

00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,020
better.

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,980
Maybe we want to visualize it
to document it, maybe for other

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
users.

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,840
Maybe we want to do simulations
that we can't do on the

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,470
real system, but for which we'd
rather work with a simpler model.

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:23,500
And a system could just be there,
or it could be yet to be created.

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:32,880
It could be a computer science system or
a very general system coming from the world

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
of handling.

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,050
To be a little bit more concrete or

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,340
to remind you that you have, of
course, already worked with models, have already seen

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,950
models, here are a few short
slides on typical models, classical examples

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,580
from the natural sciences.

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,750
Of course, a lot of work is done
with models, because you can't always fully grasp the

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,380
real systems that
are involved, for example.

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,660
Or because you can think
about certain questions better with models.

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,880
So, what would be such
a classic model from physics?

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,139
There are several
atomic models, for example.

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,880
According to current knowledge, atoms
consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Strictly speaking, these parts consist of even
smaller subparticles, but one could now say that

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,889
we are not interested
in that, for example.

00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:29,419
There, we carry out a simplification, an
abstraction, and simply want to understand how atoms

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,400
on this decomposition level
consist of these parts.

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,800
It's about how these particles interact,
and how they make up an atom.

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,289
And there's actually not just one model.

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,830
There's a whole series of models that
have been gradually refined and improved throughout

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,230
the history of physics.

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:57,810
So, the beginning is made by Thomson's atomic model,
where it was already recognized that there are positive

00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,810
and negative charges.

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,610
And the idea here was
a bit like a raisin cake.

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,620
There is this big positively charged atom
and in it are peppered negative charge carriers.

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,820
This was imagined because one had
observed the electrons in the context

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,960
of electric current.

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,510
So one knew, there must be these charges.

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,380
The electrons are mobile;
that is how one imagined it.

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,580
They are small particles embedded in a
big atom, and the positive and

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,770
negative charges are the same.

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,290
And that's why the
atom as such is neutral.

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,070
Then there were further physical experiments and
it turned out that it could not be

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,700
that the positive charge is distributed so
large, so to speak, in such a large

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
object.

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,950
But actually, the atomic nucleus, which
carries only the positive charge, is much

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,950
smaller.

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,570
Rutherford's experiments have revealed this
or brought it to light.

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,800
And therefore the conclusion came:

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,690
No, there is this small nucleus,
which unites all positive charge, and the

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,760
negative electrons move around
it within a certain perimeter.

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,160
That is, a certain distance
they do not leave.

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,029
They are trapped near the nucleus.

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,230
Then, further observations were made.

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,260
The Bohr atomic model, which is
mostly used in school physics today, has

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,870
established that the electrons are not
just randomly distributed around the atomic nucleus,

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,480
but that they move
in shells, along certain paths.

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,660
And that this is very important for
chemical processes, for example: to know on which

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,850
positions the individual
electrons are located.

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,370
And that's why the Bohr
atomic model makes these additional statements

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,300
about how the electrons are
distributed around the atomic nucleus.

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,130
And with quantum theory, quantum
physics, it has turned out that this

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,480
is actually not so simple, because
of the dual wave/particle character, to imagine

00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,360
these electrons simply
hanging at certain positions.

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,170
But actually, one must work
with orbits, thus distribution probabilities, where

00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,820
the particles are.

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,020
Because of the final character, that
these particles also behave like waves.

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,100
So in the end, it's all
about residence probabilities instead of actual specific positions.

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,540
And now we could say, this is the
best model, this seems to correspond to the most

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
modern physics.

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,500
But in fact, even these simple
models are still relevant in physics.

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,550
In particular, in school physics, this model
is usually used in the first place.

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,890
Because it is sufficiently and exactly correctly
detailed for the things that one examines

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,890
there.

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:39,290
So one may have initially used very simple models here,
perhaps due to the

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,740
lower level of knowledge potential
or lesser understanding.

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,350
But even today, one can still decide on
a level of detail that represents the relationships to

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,459
be well investigated.

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,200
And we should see that with other
models as well, that it can make sense

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,460
to have different modeling levels for the
same system, depending on what one actually wants

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,339
to investigate.

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:11,330
Another example that I can't really say
too much about comes from biology.

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,080
It's quite nice here in the presentation, but
I can't say much about the content, because

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,780
I'm not as well educated in biology myself
as I am in physics, I would think.

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,720
So here, obviously, an
acid exchange cycle is described.

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,690
And I actually don't want to
go into individual parts at all.

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,170
But what's interesting, why it's also in
here, is because it has a certain characteristic

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,200
difference to the example before.

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Namely, this seems to be about a process.

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,360
Here, it was actually about:

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
How are atoms constructed?

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,070
So back here, these probability distributions
appear; that also has something dynamic to it.

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,170
So, how do these particles move?

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,400
Where are they, and when?

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,130
But especially these first three
models here, they are rather static.

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,130
It's about which subparticles
an atom consists of?

00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,480
How are they arranged?

00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Where are they located?

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Maybe also: with what
charges are they associated?

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,000
At which energy levels are
they located on different levels?

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,029
But in essence, simply
a state is described.

00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,490
This is what the
specific atom looks like.

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,860
Here, in this model, it's
obviously about describing a process.

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,040
That's why we're going to call this
a dynamic model, obviously for acid exchange cycle/processes.

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,620
Products are transformed.

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,720
There is also some information here
about the composition and ratio in which

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,670
the individual components
interact with each other.

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,279
But in any case,
a transformation is described here.

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,459
We will soon refer to this
as a dynamic model.

00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,100
And this model came
up very briefly just now.

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,220
It's interesting in that it's very
graphical, perhaps in a very popular

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,250
scientific way.

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,519
I wouldn't zoom in on it
now and describe the individual parts here.

00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,110
But this is also something that you
know as a model, perhaps from geography lessons,

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,050
when climate and processes
of the atmosphere were described somehow.

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:11,731
What is striking about this model, but
also certainly about the two examples before it,

00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:18,440
is that a lot of visual and
graphical transport of information is used here.

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,530
Of course, this does not
always have to be the case.

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,830
When it comes to:

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,779
What kinds of models
are we going to have?

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,970
Or what kinds of models
will appear in computer science?

00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,620
There is a first difference, namely:

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,660
Is modeling visual or textual?

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,280
The examples just now were very visual.

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,040
Of course, you can also model with
more textual means, such as verbal

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,980
descriptions or mathematical formulas, which are
also used in some kind of context.

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,410
These would be mathematical models that
you encounter in logic, in algebra.

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,950
Depending on which mathematics lecture you have
already heard or are listening to in

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,709
parallel, you will also encounter models.

00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,730
These are not primarily the kind of
models we're going to look at here.

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,820
Because we will not look at formal logical models
in this course (not quite true anymore), because

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,200
there are other courses for that
in your respective fields of study.

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,030
Of course, this does not mean that
a model is always exactly only visual or

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,030
only textual.

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:18,740
So the atomic models, which were somehow
also visually represented on the slide before

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,830
the last, are of course also backed up
with formulas in physics, with the mathematical descriptions

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,630
behind them.

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,529
And that is then
again rather mathematical text.

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:34,460
In this course, we will
often work with graphical representations.

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,910
Not as free-form as here (a colorful
picture), but already in a very disciplined way

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,519
to represent something graphically.

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,660
So it's more formal than
just a painted picture as here.

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,150
But also not as formal
as formal logic operates to describe

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,200
connections.

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,870
That has partly didactic reasons that you
see something like that in the course.

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,790
Of course, a graphical
representation helps to better understand

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,790
models.

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,350
And that's why graphical models or at
least model languages with visual components are

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,550
often used in practice.

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:17,899
So that would be a first distinction:
visual model vs. textual model, but of

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,360
course there are
also intermediate levels.

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,769
Another distinction that can be
made is between so-called qualitative

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,000
and quantitative models.

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,860
Qualitative, quantitative, that you know as
terms of course, simply from the

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
language.

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,269
So, qualitative,
is somehow the description:

00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:37,089
What, How, Why?

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,089
Quantitative:

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,470
Description of quantities or numbers.

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,430
How much, how often?

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:46,730
So, typical questions for consideration
of qualitative models would be:

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,769
What objects are there?

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,240
In the atom, which objects occur in it?

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,350
Which small
particles, protons, electrons?

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,019
What characteristics or relationships do they
have with each other?

00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,230
What happens?

00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,230
Not:

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,670
In what order, how often, when?

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,670
But:

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,670
What happens qualitatively?

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,670
Why does it happen?

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,809
The reasons for certain processes.

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,980
Maybe also the order/causal connections,
but no statements about quantities

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,929
or numbers
or numerical values/measurements.

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,089
So, questions about: what, how, why.

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,490
And in contrast
to that, we have quantitative models.

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,490
There it is about:

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,410
How many objects are there?

00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,390
In what quantity ratio do
these different kinds of objects occur?

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,950
How long might a process take
(if it's a process that is being modeled)?

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,580
How likely is a particular event?

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,480
I had talked about the probability
distribution in the fourth atomic model.

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,540
That would clearly then be a
quantitative aspect that is being modeled there.

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,630
In the lecture, we will be dealing
with qualitative models for the most part.

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,490
But there will also be some places
where quantitative aspects come into play, but

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,180
less so.

00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,500
Certainly, this is also because, of course, you usually have
to identify the objects first

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,799
before you can talk about "how many".

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,160
So of course, "quantitative" is often
a refinement or enrichment of qualitative

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,720
models by additional information.

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:19,150
That is, of the models we've
had here, probably the first three are

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,750
more qualitative.

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,240
Whereas, especially in the Bohr atom model,
you also have a quantitative aspect, because

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,480
you have these different energy levels
on which the electrons can move.

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,320
These would also be described by
numbers, perhaps distances, or energy quantities.

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,670
The orbital model
is clearly quantitative.

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,860
In it, one calculates with
probabilities, which are numerical statements.

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,290
In the model, one initially
certainly has a qualitative modeling as well.

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,650
By this sequence, which is described,
and the listings or compilation of

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,040
the different products that occur (chemical
products that are in play).

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,490
But there's also at least some quantitative
parts here, because we're talking about ratios of

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,160
substances and quantities of
substances, through these numbers here.

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:12,590
And here you also have more of a
qualitative model, because there are no formulas or

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,610
numbers.

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,640
Another distinction that will
be relevant is the question:

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,210
How visible, then, are
the internals of a model?

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,360
This is often framed as
black box versus white box.

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,270
So, do we have a black box in front of
us, so to speak, where we can only describe behavior

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,790
that is observable from the outside, but we
don't know what is happening inside this black

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,790
box?

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:45,770
Or do we have such a glass
box, or white box in English, where

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,950
we can also describe what, why,
and how this externally observable behavior is generated

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,950
inside the system?

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:59,360
So, if we imagine a software system,
then "blackbox" would simply be the description/modeling:

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,330
What happens from the user's point
of view when certain buttons are

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,330
pressed in the program?

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,550
One can only say:

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,010
If this and that is pressed, then the
following window opens and there is a certain message

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,200
in it.

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Whitebox would be, if one also has the
program code or at least a description of the

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,370
internal operations (that does not have to be
the actual program code), or perhaps a pseudo code

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,110
description of the internal operations
of the system, before itself.

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,990
And one can also analyze why
a certain behavior occurs, or perhaps

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,039
a certain expected
behavior does not occur.

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,260
So, you could imagine:

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:42,980
"Blackbox" would be a description for
customers and offers more freedom to the

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,900
implementer, because only the externally observable behavior
is important, and internally, what happens,

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,920
is up to the developer.

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,951
In contrast, a "Whitebox" view of a system, or whitebox modeling,
would be important for the technical team that

00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:01,090
is building a
particular software, for example.

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,380
Of course, this also has to deal with
how this behavior should be generated inside in

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,380
the first place.

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,450
There are also intermediate levels.

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,620
There is the term greybox.

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:16,730
That would be "not completely visible", not
all details, but also not entirely

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,809
hidden, what's happening inside.

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,299
For us, this will be most
interesting in dynamic modeling or dynamic

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,620
modeling parts.

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:35,220
Now I have already spoken several times
about static and dynamic without previously defining what

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,910
exactly is meant by that.

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,010
Certainly also because static
and dynamic as colloquial terms

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,800
are hopefully clear enough.

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
So:

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,400
A static model primarily describes the
structure or a particular state of the

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,530
system.

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,679
The structure could be, for example:

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,940
How is this
system composed of subsystems?

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,360
That could be aspects of the
structure that you want to describe.

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,670
Or at a certain point in time:

00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,940
What is the state of the system?

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,920
Where are the electrons
lined up around the nucleus?

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:14,600
This might be about describing a
generally fixed state, or if

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,870
the system has the potential to evolve,
then the static description of the state

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,020
at a particular time.

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,230
In contrast:

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:31,850
A dynamic model at least
also describes how the system evolves.

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,630
So it could be that one or
more possible processes of the system are

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:42,039
described, or even the whole system
behavior with all its possible processes.

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,600
Of course, this will usually be based on
the fact that one first has a static

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
description.

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
First, you have to know which parts the system
consists of, in order to then be able to say

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,990
how these parts change their
relationship to each other, for example.

00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:02,360
So, a dynamic model will often
include or build on a static model.

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,340
Of course, I had
said earlier, for example, here:

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,460
The first three models
are more static in nature.

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:19,940
This one is more dynamic because it's
also about these movements of subparticles.

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,880
Here I also said:

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,110
It also has dynamic parts
because of these conversion processes, obviously.

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:36,260
Also, here, if you zoom in a
little bit, you would find some dynamic aspects.

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:48,040
And then we have another important distinction, which
is the degree of formality of the models.

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,490
So how accurate are these models?

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,850
And there you can just go
from one extreme to the other.

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,169
You can have completely formal models, which
are mainly the models that you find in

00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,470
mathematical lectures or in logic.

00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,440
So they are completely
exact in their statements.

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,720
Capture the relationships at stake completely,
exactly (which may not always be

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
possible, in reality).

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,110
So formal models, if they exist, are
of course very nice because they make very

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,110
precise statements.

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,250
But reality is sometimes not to
be grasped in such a way.

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:26,789
That's why at the other extreme of
the spectrum, there are non-formal models that just

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:28,929
describe something, maybe verbally.

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:37,080
So if I ask you what a car
looks like, you can just make certain statements about

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,169
it that just describe it colloquially.

00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:40,360
That would be very non-formal.

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,900
I can't derive any statements from that,
maybe how well this car will perform in

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,289
a crash test.

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,530
I would need something more formal there.

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,539
And then in the middle,
there are the so-called semi-formal models.

00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,360
"Semi" for "half" or "almost."

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,410
So these are models
that are partially exact.

00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:04,100
They use certain notation, for example, in
order to be able to express parts

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,350
precisely, but they also
do not specify everything completely.

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,940
So, they don't have the claim, like
an exact mathematical model, to capture everything on

00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,090
the desired modeling level.

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:23,120
And we will see formal models in
the lecture, especially in the Petri net part

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,340
(which is a typical quite
formal model, a formal modeling notation).

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,840
But a lot of the lecture will
be more in the area of semi-formal models.

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,669
So, UML (this modeling language from
software engineering that I've already mentioned

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:48,000
at least in the literature part),
that's a classic example of semi-formal modeling.

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,789
And of course, the decision on which
of these three levels you move depends, on

00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,429
the one hand, on
the skills and the possibilities.

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:02,090
So some things you just
can't describe with arbitrary precision.

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,670
And often, of course, it's also about:

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,210
What is the purpose of the model?

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,480
So, why do you model?

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,710
This also determines how precise and
elaborate the description has to be.

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,610
If something is to be verified formally,
then the model should also be very formal.

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,340
If the main purpose is to
simply communicate about the system you are

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,389
dealing with, then a very
non-formal description may be sufficient.
