00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Let us come to
the concept of concurrency.

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,730
There it is that concurrency (like

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,780
causality) always refers
to single transitions.

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,350
With the causality we had observed

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,810
that in a Petri net two
certain transitions can stand in this relationship.

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,720
That is, that one transition is
a "necessary condition" for the other.

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,610
In concurrency, this could be even
more than two transitions that we consider.

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,240
Therefore here the definition is formulated
for any transitions t1 to tn.

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,910
So we consider a subset T'
of the set T of all transitions.

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,790
And then we can number
the transitions, for example, which

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,620
we have picked out there.

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,120
And then, if necessary, they are
activated concurrently for a certain marking.

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,030
This is also a difference to
before, namely that the causality always simply

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,260
relates to two transitions, and
then there is a criterion that

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
relates to reachability
in the reachability graph.

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,790
Whereas concurrency, that is defined for

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,850
a set of transitions
and a certain marking m.

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,440
And then the criterion
is as follows, first mathematically.

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,180
We'll see what that
means intuitively in a moment.

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,790
Mathematically, the procedure
is simply as follows

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,140
One takes these transitions t1 to
tn, which are of course different

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,770
(otherwise this would not be a
set), thus different transitions t1 to tn.

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,410
One considers in each
case their pre-weight functions.

00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,780
As we remember, these
are "markings", i.e. functions from

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,580
the place set into the natural numbers.

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,770
And you can add
them with this special plus.

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,090
We remember, that was addition, which
is a little bit like vector addition.

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,120
So where we add in places
the entries of these n pre-weight functions.

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,610
And what comes out of
that is, again, a "marking."

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,150
And we then check whether this is
less-equal than the chosen relevant marking m.

00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,620
And this smaller-equal, also to remember (or
to look up in the old slides),

00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,790
that meant that per place the entry
that arose here on the left side must

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,870
be smaller-equal to the entry on
the right side at the corresponding place.

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,720
So it's not about somehow
counting all the tokens in total,

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,820
it's about a place-by-place comparison.

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,480
And if this is
fulfilled, then it means intuitively

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,420
that ultimately the marking m contains
enough tokens, at all relevant places, that

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,720
the transitions from T' (these t1
to tn) could in principle fire simultaneously.

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,630
Simultaneously in the sense of parallel.

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,220
After all, we had already
intuitively discussed the notions of "concurrent"

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,450
and "parallel", and I had talked
about "concurrent" being the formal criterion

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,870
that would in
principle allow concurrent-parallel execution.

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,100
So relevant here is
indeed the difference to causality.

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,270
If we look again at an example
from the previous video on causality, there we

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,220
had this example and observed for example
that t1 was necessary condition for t4.

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:22,730
In the sense that
we had sequential dependence.

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,190
So t4, when we started like this
with this Petri net, could never be

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,780
fired if t1 was not fired before.

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,635
And that was also true for t1 and t2.

00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:34,700
But t2 and t3 were independent,
and in fact we will see in

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,720
a moment that t2 and t3 here
are parallel or just concurrent in certain senses.

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,070
The causality referred
to sequential order.

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,220
So, for example, t2 can never be fired

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,460
if t1 was not fired
before (because of this dependence here).

00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,340
While t2 and t3 were
not dependent in this sense.

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,040
And in fact these will
be recognized as concurrent right away.

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,670
We had also looked at
this in the reachability graph.

00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,400
And there the argument, for example,
for t4 depending on t1 was

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,380
that t1 is a necessary condition for t4.

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,220
That we can never execute t4
if we haven't executed t1 first.

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,290
So there, too, it
was about sequential order.

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,660
Whereas t2, t3 just had
no such relationship to each other.

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,770
And in fact, if we look at t2
and t3 here, how they can fire out of

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:26,030
this marking, then we can already
sense a bit of parallelism here.

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,760
Or at least "indifference" regarding the
order and perhaps also complete independence.

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,530
Namely, we can fire t2 from
here and then t3 to get to

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,460
this marking; and obviously we
could have fired t3, t2 instead.

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,540
Why is that?

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,600
Because basically t2 and t3
are firing completely independently here.

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,430
The t2 makes sure that
this 1 moves to here.

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,110
Yes, here in the marking you can see
that, that this 1 goes from here to here.

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,220
And t3 means that this
1 goes from here to here.

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:07,070
So t2 ultimately depends on this 1 here, t3
depends on this 1 here, at this position, and

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,770
these are conditions
that are completely independent.

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,340
So basically, nobody would prevent
t2 and t3 from taking this

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,700
token and this token, respectively, at the same
time, and putting that down on the last position.

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,360
What would that mean?

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,430
That we would then
have the 2 here, (0,0,0,2).

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,355
And of course, that's what
happens down here after we fire

00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:27,470
t2, t3 in any order.

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,050
So we'll see in a moment that actually
starting from this marking, t2 and t3 are

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,710
basically parallel, or concurrent, and
could fire simultaneously if we didn't

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,640
want to write this down
so sequentially as a reachability graph.

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,300
So this scheme here, this "diamond"
(that's also what it's called, this

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,610
shape in the reachability graph where
t2 and t3 are just so alternately

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,440
fireable), that's at least an
indication of such potentially parallel behavior.

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:07,910
So in this sense one could already
speak of simultaneous firing in this example.

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,720
Also important:

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,490
We just looked at this
in a reachability graph, but

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,040
in fact this definition refers
to a concrete marking, not to

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,750
the reachability graph as a whole.

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,380
So it's not going to be
about analyzing the reachability graph as

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,480
a whole and identifying
any properties in it.

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Rather, it is always about a
concrete marking and what is possible there.

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,100
We can see here that
this condition actually refers to

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,740
this marking and not
to the reachability graph.

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,060
Okay, then one can
make another observation here,

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,770
which is very obvious
already from the intuitive understanding.

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,650
Namely, if we have such a set
of transitions whose elements are concurrent for

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:55,540
a given marking, then this is
also true for any subset of T'.

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,870
So, of course, we
are potentially always looking for

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,970
large sets that
are simultaneously concurrently activated.

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,080
If we have transitions t1, t2,
t3 and they are concurrently activated, then

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,260
only t1, t2 together
would also be concurrently activated.

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,330
And in particular, of course, the individual
transitions t1, t2, t3 are also activated.

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,270
It cannot be that t1,
t2, t3 are activated concurrently,

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,920
but t2 itself is not activated.

00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,830
In the end, we can already
see this from this mathematical definition.

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,540
Because if we simply ignore
some of the transitions on

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,580
the left, nothing can change
in the occurrence of this inequality.

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,200
Because if we omit something on the

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,910
left, these terms can become at
the most still smaller in the sum.

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,320
So they remain in any
case below the chosen marking.

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,460
This is the reason why
this observation is valid, mathematically.

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,030
But we can also think about
it intuitively, for example, using the examples.

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,220
Of course, this is
only interesting from two-element sets.

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,240
So, that also a one-element
set can be concurrently activated; there is

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,145
not really something concurrently activated, if
that is n = 1.

00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,310
So it is
interesting from two-element sets.

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,940
And the larger the set, the
nicer, so to speak, as an observation.

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:15,520
Okay, a first example.

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,710
And in fact, this is the Petri
net, which we had also already looked

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,400
at in causality, and which I
had also just come back to.

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,830
And I had just indicated that
here t2 and t3 are activated concurrently.

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,550
However, not in
the initial constellation.

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:42,040
So it doesn't make sense to say
that here t2 and t3 are activated concurrently.

00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,410
They are not activated
at all in this situation.

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,160
But only in the case after
t1 has fired, for example, t2

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,490
and t3 would be activated,
and that even concurrently.

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,150
But we don't talk about
"we fire this and this and

00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,190
this", but we take a concrete marking.

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,490
And that's just not the one, but the
one from the slide that I just looked at.

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,300
And then ask ourselves:

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,280
Are t2 and t3
activated concurrently for this marking?

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,680
So for this marking,
for the start marking here,

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,580
t2 and t3 would not be activated
concurrently, because they are not even activated themselves.

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,080
But in this concrete constellation,
t2 and t3 are concurrently activated.

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,520
We can calculate that in a moment.

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,060
We will do that, too.

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,640
But for this and other examples

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,090
in between, I want to demonstrate
this again in the whiteboard app.

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:38,560
That is, I'm going to run through this first
and two or three other examples in the app.

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,615
Where you can also
see how the tokens move.

00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:43,150
Where we can see in each
case what is concurrent or not.

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,460
And then I'll come back
to the slides here and

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,570
run the associated
calculations in each case.
