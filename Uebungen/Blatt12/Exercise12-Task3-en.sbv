0:00:02.400,0:00:15.660
This task is about modeling with state charts.
And yeah, we've been given a text task which

0:00:15.660,0:00:21.300
we have to read and then understand and
then we have to create a state chart.

0:00:22.140,0:00:28.140
For its next invention Gyro Gearloose
needs a device which allows to input

0:00:28.140,0:00:36.900
numbers consisting of three digits from one
to four. Gyro envisages the device as follows.

0:00:38.580,0:00:45.540
The device has a screen with three digits on it.
At each moment exactly one of the three digits is

0:00:45.540,0:00:52.320
active. At the beginning, all three digits are
equal to one, and the leftmost digit is active.

0:00:52.320,0:01:01.620
Additionally, the device has five buttons.
Plus, minus, L, R, and OK. When plus or minus

0:01:02.340,0:01:09.180
is pressed, the active digit is incremented,
respectively decremented by one.

0:01:10.260,0:01:18.720
If the digit would become higher than four
or lower than one by this, then it becomes

0:01:18.720,0:01:33.300
one respectively four.

0:01:33.300,0:01:39.240
The buttons L
and R have structurally different functions.

0:01:40.500,0:01:46.680
Pressing R activates the digit to the right
of the current active one. If the rightmost

0:01:46.680,0:01:55.440
digit is already active before pressing of R,
then instead the leftmost digit becomes active.

0:01:56.280,0:02:01.380
Pressing L on the other hand will
always switch to the leftmost digit.

0:02:02.220,0:02:11.460
If that one is not already active anyway.
When okay is pressed, the input process ends.

0:02:12.000,0:02:20.040
And now we have to help Gyro by giving a UML
state diagram, modeling the descriptive device

0:02:21.120,0:02:26.280
and we have to use hierarchical states
and possibly regions in order to keep

0:02:26.280,0:02:36.180
the size of the model reasonably small.
And here is a picture of the device. So,

0:02:36.180,0:02:45.720
we have three digits going up to four, and we
have plus, minus button buttons, L R and OK.

0:02:47.820,0:02:57.600
So, I guess we should start by having some states.
At least, we require these four number states

0:02:57.600,0:03:14.880
for each digit. So, maybe let's just start by
having those states here as numbers. So, 1, 2, 3

0:03:19.980,0:03:29.700
and 4. These are just states for the numbers.
So, these we require anyway, probably for all

0:03:29.700,0:03:40.860
of the digits. But let's just start with the
obvious things. So, we have plus and minus, which

0:03:40.860,0:03:53.460
shall change the state. When we press plus, we
increment the number. So, that's this direction.

0:03:56.160,0:04:03.180
And when we are already at
the highest number-. Maybe

0:04:04.560,0:04:12.660
let's draw this from here. When we
are already at the highest number,

0:04:15.780,0:04:20.640
then we go back to the first. So,

0:04:26.340,0:04:39.840
let me choose a plus here as design for
incrementing the numbers and then we have the

0:04:39.840,0:04:48.420
other direction as well. So, we can go from four
to three by decrementing using the minus button.

0:04:52.200,0:05:05.880
And again from, when we reach one, and
we press minus, we end up in four again.

0:05:07.320,0:05:17.100
Okay, so this was the easy
part of this functionality.

0:05:18.660,0:05:27.660
So, this is just for one digit, okay? And
we have somehow to repeat the whole process.

0:05:28.620,0:05:46.140
So, let me make this a bit more dense and
add the labels inside here. So, basically that's what

0:05:50.700,0:05:59.460
the switching of the numbers does, and
we have this whole thing three times,

0:06:00.120,0:06:09.720
and we have one number which is active, and
then we have two numbers, which are inactive.

0:06:10.440,0:06:20.400
And this could lead to the thought that we can use
actually history in order to store the values. So,

0:06:20.400,0:06:28.620
we could keep track of the other
numbers using history. And therefore,

0:06:28.620,0:06:38.040
we would require for each digit a history point
as well. So, I will add a history node here. And

0:06:40.200,0:06:49.860
that's the basic part which I have in
mind for yeah, using or reusing this part.

0:06:51.120,0:07:01.500
So, I will create a state around this, which
basically contains the whole part here.

0:07:06.360,0:07:20.580
So, this shall be a basic state that we can now
repeat three times so that we have three digits.

0:07:28.440,0:07:40.980
And yeah, we can of course, label them. I
haven't added a label yet. So, one is digit

0:07:41.580,0:07:46.260
one and then we have digit two and three as well

0:07:51.180,0:08:08.400
and the digit three. These are the parts. And
yeah, we can switch from each part to another part

0:08:14.220,0:08:26.700
by going there using the history
node. So, we can switch from the

0:08:27.360,0:08:38.520
first part, from the first digit to the second
using the history when we use the R button. So,

0:08:38.520,0:08:42.660
when we are in this state, we can use
the R button and then we will switch

0:08:42.660,0:08:48.240
to the second number and then we can use the
R button and it will be at the third number.

0:08:49.680,0:09:03.480
And we can check the text again. It activates
the digit to the right, this R button. And

0:09:07.860,0:09:15.060
if the rightmost button is active, then
we use our in order to go to the leftmost

0:09:15.060,0:09:26.880
button. Okay. So, maybe I moved this label over
here so that I can draw labels here.

0:09:28.560,0:09:34.560
Okay, so maybe let's go from here.

0:09:43.980,0:09:56.400
We can go from digit two to digit
three, we can go from digit one to digit two.

0:10:00.960,0:10:07.440
Maybe I move the whole part a bit. So,
that we have a bit more space in between.

0:10:12.420,0:10:26.160
Okay. So, and when we are in digit
three, then we can go back to digit one

0:10:28.500,0:10:34.620
and this should be the history
node that we reach then.

0:10:42.480,0:10:51.900
So, this is the R button. So, let's create
labels for these, this is the R button

0:10:57.960,0:11:08.640
and then we have the L button as well, which
always leads to the leftmost digit. So,

0:11:08.640,0:11:14.880
we can skip it for the first digit actually,
because when we are at first digit,

0:11:16.020,0:11:25.140
we are not required to go to the leftmost digit
because we are already there. So, there is no such

0:11:27.420,0:11:35.580
required. If we are in the right most we simply
reuse this one here. So, we use L in this case

0:11:36.240,0:11:54.360
and then we have digit two when we want press L
there then we actually-, when we are here, then

0:11:58.800,0:12:17.880
we can go up there. Okay. So, this is
L in this case. It's quite tight here.

0:12:18.840,0:12:32.700
Maybe I should move these arrows a bit out so
that we can see it properly. So, these are

0:12:36.120,0:12:45.960
different. So, this is for L and this is for
R and L. So, this makes it maybe much clearer.

0:12:49.140,0:13:03.420
Move this up here. So, and okay, this is what
remembering the state's just as histories,

0:13:03.960,0:13:14.460
but we need to provide more information and that
is especially how the whole action starts. And

0:13:17.400,0:13:20.040
I will make some more space here.

0:13:24.600,0:13:31.920
Yeah, we need another state around the
whole thing which is the complete device.

0:13:33.840,0:13:50.220
So, I create a new state and this should be the
device and I want to place this whole thing into

0:13:52.800,0:14:04.680
and because state is maybe, like this.

0:14:10.440,0:14:30.600
So, this is the complete state around it. And
now we can think about how to enter the state.

0:14:37.080,0:14:46.860
So, the device has screen with three digits
that's was what it says and we have

0:14:48.420,0:14:52.620
at the beginning all three
digits are equal to one.

0:14:54.180,0:15:01.320
So, and we start with the leftmost digit, and
we can represent this so we have start state.

0:15:05.460,0:15:16.560
Let's start with the outermost starting state,
which simply goes to our device here. So, we go

0:15:16.560,0:15:28.740
from here to our outer state, which represents the
device. And then we have a starting state inside,

0:15:29.880,0:15:35.580
which is the first number, because this
is where we are going to start by selecting.

0:15:36.780,0:15:45.000
So, that's our inner starting state. And
then we start at one. So, this is another

0:15:45.720,0:16:04.200
starting state. So, we start at one. Okay.
Then we have the history,

0:16:05.700,0:16:13.860
which when we leave the state, we can
either go to digit two, or digit three.

0:16:13.860,0:16:22.980
And they are all starting at one. That is why
we require an arrow from our history to one.

0:16:25.920,0:16:37.080
So, that means when we switch the digit
using R or L, well, L donâ€™t make sense,

0:16:37.800,0:16:46.140
digit one. But when we switch to the right,
using R, we are in our first in state one. And

0:16:46.140,0:16:52.800
then if you switch to two, and use R, then we
start here in one as well. And when we switch

0:16:54.900,0:17:03.420
to two here, and then switch using or L
back to digit one, and then go to R again,

0:17:03.420,0:17:08.100
then we have the history remember
our old state, and we'll be there again.

0:17:09.720,0:17:26.460
So, that means we keep track of our history.
And thus, we keep the state and as we have

0:17:26.460,0:17:33.300
the starting state in digit one, and we start in
digit one, how we can just keep our history node

0:17:33.300,0:17:41.160
around. So, this is flat history here, because
it's enough, we just require the history to

0:17:41.160,0:17:52.080
keep the state at that level. So, remember,
a digit from one state from one to four, for our

0:17:52.740,0:18:01.920
digits. And, yeah, you have the starting state
here, and there's just one thing left. And

0:18:03.180,0:18:12.240
that is ending the whole thing.
And the task says for the ending,

0:18:12.900,0:18:20.460
that we can have a OK button. And when
we press OK, the input process ends.

0:18:21.420,0:18:36.240
So, you have an end state here. And whenever we
are ready, we can you can use this state here.

0:18:37.620,0:18:50.040
Okay. And there is the label missing. So, this
is the OK button. And now, let's check back to

0:18:50.040,0:18:59.880
our picture, we have the plus buttons represented
here in our digits, we have the minus buttons in

0:18:59.880,0:19:07.500
which go the opposite direction decrementing
the numbers and we have our L and R. L going

0:19:07.500,0:19:12.900
always to the leftmost state, but when we are
in digit one, we don't have to change anything.

0:19:12.900,0:19:21.780
And the R button which goes from digit one to
digit two, and from digit two to digit three,

0:19:21.780,0:19:32.520
and from digit three to digit one. And we have the
OK button, which ends the whole process. And so,

0:19:35.400,0:19:41.160
I just realized it wasn't in view
here below so plus minus, L, R and OK.

0:19:43.380,0:19:49.020
So, we are done with our state
diagram and solve this task as well.
