0:00:02.620,0:00:12.580
This exercise task is about properties of
Petri nets, and we have been given two reachability

0:00:12.580,0:00:19.820
graphs for Petri nets so we do not have the
actual Petri nets in one and two but only

0:00:19.820,0:00:21.880
their reachability graphs.

0:00:21.880,0:00:30.619
But nevertheless, we are able to decide on
whether some properties are valid

0:00:30.619,0:00:32.360
for the Petri nets.

0:00:32.360,0:00:39.320
Especially when we have given the information
that there are four transitions for each Petri

0:00:39.320,0:00:40.320
net.

0:00:40.320,0:00:46.660
We know that within the original Petri
nets, there are four transitions but we

0:00:46.660,0:00:51.219
do not know the actual Petri nets.

0:00:51.219,0:01:01.220
Let us consider all these properties.

0:01:01.220,0:01:08.530
For the actual task, you have to fill in the
properties below, so whether they're valid

0:01:08.530,0:01:18.619
or not, but also indicate the reasons why
these properties hold or do not hold.

0:01:18.619,0:01:23.520
I will not write down the actual properties.

0:01:23.520,0:01:30.560
I would just indicate to properties within
this table here.

0:01:30.560,0:01:40.880
But I will talk about the reasons why
I fill in the table the way I'll do.

0:01:40.880,0:01:53.320
Let's have a look at the first Petri net and
the first property, which is strongly live.

0:01:53.320,0:02:01.399
It does look like that we can reach all the
states within the reachability graph, and

0:02:01.399,0:02:10.810
so
this Petri net or the Petri net belonging to

0:02:10.810,0:02:16.170
this reachability graph is probably strongly
live.

0:02:16.170,0:02:23.730
And we can check if first of all, that we
can reach all the nodes from each node and

0:02:23.730,0:02:28.280
as we have a cycle here, it is possible.

0:02:28.280,0:02:38.310
So that's the first reason that this strongly
live can reach all the nodes from each other.

0:02:38.310,0:02:45.510
And the second part which we have to check
is that all the transitions are within the

0:02:45.510,0:02:52.120
reachability graph, because then we can fire
all the transitions as well.

0:02:52.120,0:02:55.670
We just choose one state in the reachability
graph.

0:02:55.670,0:02:57.480
Let's choose (0,1,1).

0:02:57.480,0:03:00.010
So the starting state.

0:03:00.010,0:03:06.940
So, when we choose this marking, then we know,
when we have this marking in the Petri

0:03:06.940,0:03:07.940
net.

0:03:07.940,0:03:11.349
We can fire t4, t1, and t3.

0:03:11.349,0:03:19.010
And now we have to check only that we can
also fire t2 when we start from this marking.

0:03:19.010,0:03:20.370
And yes, we can.

0:03:20.370,0:03:25.820
When we start from this marking, we can fire
t3 and then we can fire t2.

0:03:25.820,0:03:29.790
And then we fired these transitions.

0:03:29.790,0:03:41.340
We can fire all four transitions when we started
this marking and that's why this is strongly

0:03:41.340,0:03:43.140
live.

0:03:43.140,0:03:45.220
Now check the second Petri net.

0:03:45.220,0:03:46.819
If this is strongly live as well.

0:03:46.819,0:03:53.590
In this case, we have four places as we can
see here, there are tokens given for four

0:03:53.590,0:04:01.230
places, and again we have these four transitions,
as it was mentioned in the task, and now is

0:04:01.230,0:04:02.549
this strongly live.

0:04:02.549,0:04:10.700
Well, as we have such a node here where it
seems that it is not strongly live.

0:04:10.700,0:04:12.840
Well, what we do we have to check?

0:04:12.840,0:04:26.440
Well, we have to check that we can reach another
node from this one and well, we cannot.

0:04:26.440,0:04:33.259
We cannot reach all the nodes from each other,
that's why this one is not strongly live.

0:04:33.259,0:04:37.000
Not strongly live for the second one.

0:04:37.000,0:04:45.320
Let's check if this maybe is weakly live,
although it is not strongly live.

0:04:45.320,0:05:03.660
And for this property, we check if
the reachability graph contains all the transitions.

0:05:03.660,0:05:08.240
We have t1 in the reachability graph.

0:05:08.240,0:05:12.290
We check the reachability graph if it contains
all the transitions.

0:05:12.290,0:05:21.300
And we have t1, t2, t3 and t4 within the reachability
graph.

0:05:21.300,0:05:30.139
The underlying Petri net would be weakly live
as we can fire all the transitions.

0:05:30.139,0:05:36.100
And the other Petri net for this one holds
the same.

0:05:36.100,0:05:46.670
We can also check here for all the transitions
t1 to t4, as there four transitions t1, t2

0:05:46.670,0:05:50.050
t3, and t4 are within the reachability graph.

0:05:50.050,0:05:53.009
This one is weakly live.

0:05:53.009,0:05:56.979
Now we can check for deadlock freeness.

0:05:56.979,0:06:08.500
And as weâ€™ve already mentioned, we can get
to each of the other nodes when we follow

0:06:08.500,0:06:11.720
the edges in the reachability graph.

0:06:11.720,0:06:20.380
We suggest that
it is deadlock free.

0:06:20.380,0:06:21.819
And then we check just the nodes.

0:06:21.819,0:06:29.169
If there is a node where there is no outgoing
edge, and for this node, we have this edge.

0:06:29.169,0:06:33.349
For this node, we have this edge.

0:06:33.349,0:06:35.381
For this node, we have this outgoing edge.

0:06:35.381,0:06:37.690
For this node, we have this outgoing edge.

0:06:37.690,0:06:39.470
For this node, we have this outgoing edge.

0:06:39.470,0:06:41.430
And for this node, we have this outgoing edge.

0:06:41.430,0:06:47.840
Of course, there are more outgoing edges,
but these are just the examples.

0:06:47.840,0:06:54.120
For each node we found an outgoing edge, so
we know this one is deadlock free.

0:06:54.120,0:07:00.940
Now we check the second net and there we find
a node which has no outgoing edge, so

0:07:00.940,0:07:03.590
(0,2,0,0) has no outgoing edge.

0:07:03.590,0:07:07.790
This one is actually a deadlock.

0:07:07.790,0:07:15.190
This one is not deadlock free.

0:07:15.190,0:07:19.789
This one is not deadlock free.

0:07:19.789,0:07:26.009
Now we check for safeness.

0:07:26.009,0:07:27.449
Is this net safe?

0:07:27.449,0:07:28.449
When is it safe?

0:07:28.449,0:07:34.950
It is if there is at most one token for every
place.

0:07:34.950,0:07:43.000
When we find any node in the reachability
graph where there's more than one token for

0:07:43.000,0:07:45.440
a place, it is not safe.

0:07:45.440,0:07:52.340
And in this case, we have, for example, this
node here (0,2,0,0) which contains more

0:07:52.340,0:07:59.290
than one token and for the second place, so
there are two tokens and two is greater than

0:07:59.290,0:08:00.419
one.

0:08:00.419,0:08:14.360
In fact, this is not safe and we can check
the

0:08:14.360,0:08:19.199
other Petri net for the same thing.

0:08:19.199,0:08:30.950
So now we check in one, and when we look at
this Petri net and we see that this one has

0:08:30.950,0:08:32.390
the same properties.

0:08:32.390,0:08:41.990
For instance, this node here contains two
tokens in the first place.

0:08:41.990,0:08:48.650
So (2,0,0) contains more than one token for the
first place here.

0:08:48.650,0:09:04.580
In this case, this is not safe as well.

0:09:04.580,0:09:12.279
Now we check bounded, is this Petri net bounded?

0:09:12.279,0:09:26.630
Well, we can find a constant C for each of
the tokens of the places where no node has

0:09:26.630,0:09:34.250
more tokens than this constant for these cases.
If we can, then it is bounded.

0:09:34.250,0:09:40.650
If we choose two for instance, or even
three, well two is enough in this case, or

0:09:40.650,0:09:47.260
if we choose C equals two, then we find no
node, which contains more tokens than two.

0:09:47.260,0:09:56.589
And because when we check all these numbers
here, we have only 0s, 1s and 2s

0:09:56.589,0:10:08.510
for all these nodes in the reachability graph
so in fact this is bounded.

0:10:08.510,0:10:18.270
And then we check the second net and here
again, we can choose a constant C equal to two,

0:10:18.270,0:10:24.500
it can be the same as in this case, because there
two is the highest number of tokens for a

0:10:24.500,0:10:30.120
place here for this Petri net, so in the reachability
graph

0:10:30.120,0:10:38.459
there is no number higher than two ever occurring
for any tokens in any place.

0:10:38.459,0:10:48.760
And that's why this one is bounded as well.

0:10:48.760,0:10:58.760
And then we are done with the task and have
decided all the properties.
