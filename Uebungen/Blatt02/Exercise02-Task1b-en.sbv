0:00:01.459,0:00:09.219
For the second part of the task, we are asked
to give a flat state diagram of our puzzle.

0:00:09.219,0:00:14.339
For that, we need to first think about what
a state could look like, what the starting

0:00:14.339,0:00:18.860
state is, what states are reached from the
starting state and so on.

0:00:18.860,0:00:23.170
We’ll try to explore all reachable states
and the transitions between them.

0:00:23.170,0:00:26.769
Not just the chain of states that would
lead to a goal

0:00:26.769,0:00:29.490
but all the states.

0:00:29.490,0:00:33.530
And we are told we do not need to label the transitions
necessarily.

0:00:33.530,0:00:37.500
I might or might not label them, we will see
how it goes.

0:00:37.500,0:00:43.629
First of all, I am going to move the solution
from our first part up to the corner here.

0:00:43.629,0:00:47.210
So, we have a little reminder for our rules.

0:00:47.210,0:00:51.270
And then, we need to think about what every
state should look like.

0:00:51.270,0:00:56.730
The simplest solution here is to just use
a single letter for every actor and the boat

0:00:56.730,0:00:57.920
and the river.

0:00:57.920,0:01:04.470
And then we end up with basically a little
string for every node

0:01:04.470,0:01:08.730
and that shows us what the state
is like.

0:01:08.730,0:01:14.820
I am going to put a little glossary over here
on the side.

0:01:14.820,0:01:19.460
We are going to use
the vertical line character as the river.

0:01:19.460,0:01:25.020
Because it kind of nicely shows us where everybody
is, so being on the left side of this character

0:01:25.020,0:01:30.290
is on the left side or the starting side of
the river and being on the right side would

0:01:30.290,0:01:34.950
be being on the goal side of the river.

0:01:34.950,0:01:40.020
We are going to use the upper-case B for the
boat and upper-case F for the fisherman.

0:01:40.020,0:01:44.380
And we are going to be lazy here and use the
V for father.

0:01:44.380,0:01:49.500
Because otherwise we are going to end up with
another F here and a small f might be a little

0:01:49.500,0:01:50.500
confusing.

0:01:50.500,0:01:56.659
So, we just kind of basically take a note
from the German version of this and use V

0:01:56.659,0:02:00.140
for Vater, the German father, in this
case.

0:02:00.140,0:02:03.500
And we are going to use the lower case c for each
child.

0:02:03.500,0:02:08.770
So, we are going to end up with 2 c’s in
each state.

0:02:08.770,0:02:11.340
You could also change this of course.

0:02:11.340,0:02:16.200
This is not necessarily the letter that is
supposed to be in here.

0:02:16.200,0:02:21.709
You could even use numbers if you will although
that might make it a little bit confusing.

0:02:21.709,0:02:29.170
Now, for our starting state we need everybody
on the left side of the river.

0:02:29.170,0:02:34.260
So, we are going to use the pipe character
to indicate the river and then just put all

0:02:34.260,0:02:38.780
the other letters on the left of it.

0:02:38.780,0:02:43.550
This tells us that the fisherman, the father,
both children and the boat are on the left

0:02:43.550,0:02:45.860
side of the river.

0:02:45.860,0:02:51.379
And to indicate that this is our starting
state, we need to put this arrow pointing

0:02:51.379,0:02:53.000
at it coming from nowhere.

0:02:53.000,0:02:57.709
This is just an index for signifying that
this is the starting state.

0:02:57.709,0:03:01.260
And then, from this state we need to think
which states are reachable.

0:03:01.260,0:03:02.260
So, which states are reachable.

0:03:02.260,0:03:04.430
So, what transitions are possible from here.

0:03:04.430,0:03:08.629
First of all, one child can move on
its own.

0:03:08.629,0:03:12.430
So, one child crosses together with the boat
to the other side.

0:03:12.430,0:03:17.080
Giving us with the fisherman, the father,
one child on one side of the river.

0:03:17.080,0:03:21.849
And the child and the boat that crossed over
on the other side.

0:03:21.849,0:03:26.069
From here the only possible thing is for the
child to go back.

0:03:26.069,0:03:30.860
And our transitions ends up with this double
arrow here.

0:03:30.860,0:03:34.190
This is going to be all our transitions state
diagrams.

0:03:34.190,0:03:38.670
Because no matter what state we are in it
is always possible to go back to the previous

0:03:38.670,0:03:39.670
state.

0:03:39.670,0:03:42.090
There is no other possibilities from here.

0:03:42.090,0:03:46.769
So, we move on with the other possibilities
from the starting state.

0:03:46.769,0:03:50.269
From the starting state the father can also
move over on its own.

0:03:50.269,0:03:52.579
This is also not going to lead to the goal.

0:03:52.579,0:03:54.319
But this is a state that we need to consider.

0:03:54.319,0:03:57.940
Because we are told to consider all reachable
states.

0:03:57.940,0:04:03.319
And this leaves us with the fisherman and
both children on one side and the father and

0:04:03.319,0:04:05.620
the boat on the other side.

0:04:05.620,0:04:06.739
Nothing else is possible here.

0:04:06.739,0:04:08.239
Except for the father to move back.

0:04:08.239,0:04:13.540
So, we move on with the next possible state
from the starting state, which is the fisherman

0:04:13.540,0:04:16.209
moving over on his own.

0:04:16.209,0:04:18.310
Which is also not really helpful.

0:04:18.310,0:04:21.940
Giving us the father and both children in
the starting side and the fisherman with his

0:04:21.940,0:04:24.550
boat on the goal side.

0:04:24.550,0:04:30.820
Now the only way to move towards the goal here
would be the final possible transition from

0:04:30.820,0:04:32.020
the starting state.

0:04:32.020,0:04:37.180
Which is both children crossing together,
which leaves us with the father and the fisherman

0:04:37.180,0:04:40.310
on one side and both children on the other.

0:04:40.310,0:04:47.030
From here there are only two possible states,
one is both children moving back.

0:04:47.030,0:04:52.729
So, coming back to the starting state and
one child crossing alone.

0:04:52.729,0:05:01.280
This is also a good place to point out why
we used one character for both children and

0:05:01.280,0:05:04.420
not two different characters for two different
daughters.

0:05:04.420,0:05:10.169
Because as we pointed out on the first part
of the task, the daughters are functionally

0:05:10.169,0:05:14.140
identical in terms of this task.

0:05:14.140,0:05:19.039
And using different characters for them here
would just massively complicate the state

0:05:19.039,0:05:21.970
diagram without any real benefit.

0:05:21.970,0:05:26.800
Because then we’ll end up with C and D for
example for every daughter.

0:05:26.800,0:05:30.699
And then from the starting state, we would
have the case where the first daughter moves

0:05:30.699,0:05:32.030
on her own.

0:05:32.030,0:05:34.370
And a state where the second daughter moves
on her own.

0:05:34.370,0:05:38.280
So, this is an additional state from the starting
state.

0:05:38.280,0:05:41.940
And a lot of different states going further.

0:05:41.940,0:05:45.419
Because they all kind of branch out more than
necessary here.

0:05:45.419,0:05:51.410
In terms of the task here, it is only important
that one child can cross on her own.

0:05:51.410,0:05:53.900
And which one it is doesn't really matter.

0:05:53.900,0:05:58.130
We know that one is left on one side and the
other is left on the other side.

0:05:58.130,0:06:02.150
One crosses alone, and they are basically
interchangeable here.

0:06:02.150,0:06:10.240
So, we do not need to complicate this by using
different letters for the 2 daughters.

0:06:10.240,0:06:12.760
Going back to this state.

0:06:12.760,0:06:15.870
We have one daughter crossing alone.

0:06:15.870,0:06:20.930
So, this gives us: the fisherman, the father,
one daughter and the boat on the starting

0:06:20.930,0:06:21.930
side.

0:06:21.930,0:06:24.730
And one daughter left alone on the goal side.

0:06:24.730,0:06:27.870
From here the graph can branch out basically.

0:06:27.870,0:06:33.560
Because from here it is possible that either
the fisherman crosses on his own.

0:06:33.560,0:06:36.960
Giving us this state of father and one child
on one side.

0:06:36.960,0:06:41.370
And the fisherman, the child and the boat
on the other side or the father crossing on

0:06:41.370,0:06:42.370
his own.

0:06:42.370,0:06:45.069
Leaving us with the fisherman and the child
on one side.

0:06:45.069,0:06:50.280
And the father, the boat and the child on
the goal side.

0:06:50.280,0:06:52.130
And this pattern kind of repeats here.

0:06:52.130,0:06:58.660
Because from here on both sides, one
child can cross on her own.

0:06:58.660,0:07:05.090
Or, of course, the father can move back but
this is just a backwards transition or the

0:07:05.090,0:07:09.509
fisherman can move backwards but this is just
another backwards transition as well.

0:07:09.509,0:07:16.590
So, from here the new transitions to consider
here are the children one child crossing on

0:07:16.590,0:07:17.590
her own.

0:07:17.590,0:07:21.780
So, on one side this gives us the father,
both children and the boat on the starting

0:07:21.780,0:07:22.780
side.

0:07:22.780,0:07:25.680
And the fisherman now left alone on the goal
side.

0:07:25.680,0:07:33.150
And on the other side it is basically just
always the father or the fisherman reversed

0:07:33.150,0:07:39.210
here or swapped rather.

0:07:39.210,0:07:47.810
Of course, from this point now both children
could cross together.

0:07:47.810,0:07:50.289
Or one child could move back.

0:07:50.289,0:07:55.810
Or one of the adults could cross on its own.

0:07:55.810,0:08:02.340
And this basically gives us a swapped transition
here where we can cross over into another

0:08:02.340,0:08:05.860
part of the path that we might attempt to
go.

0:08:05.860,0:08:11.060
So, when the father crosses on his own or
the fisherman crosses on his own.

0:08:11.060,0:08:13.900
It is the same resulting state here.

0:08:13.900,0:08:16.280
Both children are left alone on the starting
side.

0:08:16.280,0:08:20.690
And both adults are on the goal side.

0:08:20.690,0:08:23.600
Now moving on from this state there is nothing
possible.

0:08:23.600,0:08:25.020
Except backwards transitions.

0:08:25.020,0:08:26.620
So, moving on here.

0:08:26.620,0:08:29.680
We have both children crossing at once.

0:08:29.680,0:08:33.099
Once again on both of these transitions here.

0:08:33.099,0:08:36.650
On one side that leaves us with the father
on his own.

0:08:36.650,0:08:40.070
And the fisherman and the boat and the two
children on the other side.

0:08:40.070,0:08:43.970
And on the other side it is once again just
mirrored here.

0:08:43.970,0:08:46.170
This is now the fisherman left on the starting
side.

0:08:46.170,0:08:51.130
And the father and both children on the goal
side.

0:08:51.130,0:08:57.010
We also have this transition over here again,
where we could move over to the other side

0:08:57.010,0:09:00.320
of the solution path.

0:09:00.320,0:09:04.810
And I am going to go and skip ahead a little
bit here.

0:09:04.810,0:09:09.509
I am going to scroll down a little bit, sorry.

0:09:09.509,0:09:15.730
One child can cross on her own.

0:09:15.730,0:09:18.579
Giving us these two states.

0:09:18.579,0:09:24.560
And then the adults
can transition on their own.

0:09:24.560,0:09:31.100
Leaving us with one child on one side, the
fisherman, the father and the child and the

0:09:31.100,0:09:33.340
boat on the goal side.

0:09:33.340,0:09:37.400
Now from here there are no further
possibilities over here.

0:09:37.400,0:09:42.750
Because now we have the children separated
again on the side.

0:09:42.750,0:09:47.769
So, they cannot cross together; this is not
possible from either of these states.

0:09:47.769,0:09:52.459
And the only possibilities here are the backwards
transition or the transition that we already

0:09:52.459,0:09:53.459
have.

0:09:53.459,0:09:54.459
The child moving back.

0:09:54.459,0:09:59.710
Or the father crossing over or here once again,
the child moving back and the fisherman crossing

0:09:59.710,0:10:00.710
over.

0:10:00.710,0:10:03.500
So, from here we are going towards the solution
again.

0:10:03.500,0:10:11.380
Or we are going further towards the solution
now with the one child crossing on her own.

0:10:11.380,0:10:16.579
Giving us both children on one side with the
boat and the adults on the goal side.

0:10:16.579,0:10:22.320
And from here the children can cross together
with the boat.

0:10:22.320,0:10:24.590
And give us everybody on the goal side.

0:10:24.590,0:10:30.790
Now at this point you might forget “hey,
the fisherman and his boat need to go back

0:10:30.790,0:10:38.070
to the starting point as we discovered in
the story.

0:10:38.070,0:10:42.589
And marked in our solution for the first part
of the task”.

0:10:42.589,0:10:48.570
So, just marking this as the goal would be
an error here so we need to keep going a little

0:10:48.570,0:10:51.960
bit.

0:10:51.960,0:10:56.149
Which are the possibilities that do not lead
us to the goal first of all.

0:10:56.149,0:11:00.700
So, we do not forget anything, which is the
father moving back alone which does not lead

0:11:00.700,0:11:02.680
us anywhere.

0:11:02.680,0:11:08.930
Or one child moving back on her own, which
does not lead us anywhere either.

0:11:08.930,0:11:13.430
And finally, the fisherman taking his boat
back to the starting side giving us the goal

0:11:13.430,0:11:17.339
state which is the fisherman and the boat
at the starting side.

0:11:17.339,0:11:21.510
And the father and both children at the goal
side.

0:11:21.510,0:11:28.589
And this dash line around it here signifies
that this is the final state.

0:11:28.589,0:11:32.660
Now, as I mentioned before.

0:11:32.660,0:11:39.180
Your graph might not necessarily need to look
exactly the same as this.

0:11:39.180,0:11:44.970
This is just one way to draw the graph and
this kind of looks very tidy.

0:11:44.970,0:11:48.170
Because going down goes towards the goal state.

0:11:48.170,0:11:52.170
And we have this parallel pathway in the middle
here.

0:11:52.170,0:11:56.339
But if yours ends up looking differently that
is not a big deal, as long as the information

0:11:56.339,0:11:57.339
is correct.

0:11:57.339,0:12:01.230
And all the states are correct you can even-
like I said in the beginning, you can swap

0:12:01.230,0:12:03.610
up the letters as well.

0:12:03.610,0:12:06.600
These particularities of that are not really
important.

0:12:06.600,0:12:09.360
As long as all the states are technically
correct.
